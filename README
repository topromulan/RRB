RRB


A Rickety Rope Bridge

rrb [options] [near hw addr] [far hw addr]

RRB buffers packets seen for near hw addr and sends them to far hw addr
with configurable behavior such as how long it takes to cross the bridge,
whether all packets in order, and how many packets fall off.


Currently it doesn't take any options and just buffers the frames for
a fixed 1.5 seconds.

There are some in-kernel similar options, 'dummynet' and 'netem'
